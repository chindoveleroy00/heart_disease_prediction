                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>Heart disease remains a significant health challenge in Zimbabwe. With increasing lifestyle-related risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, the urgency for effective predictive tools is paramount. Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, as a major healthcare provider, can leverage patient data to enhance heart disease management. Implementing a predictive model will not only aid in early detection but also optimize resource allocation and improve overall healthcare delivery in the region.</p>

                        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                        <p>Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality in Zimbabwe, affecting thousands annually. The lack of timely and accurate prediction tools hampers early diagnosis and treatment. This project aims to address this gap by utilizing data-driven insights to predict heart disease risk among patients at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals.</p>

                        <h4>How The Model Works</h4>
                        <p>The heart disease prediction model uses a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest that has been trained on patient data. The model takes into account various factors such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient demographics (age, sex)</li>
                            <li>Clinical measurements (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Medical history (diabetes, hypertension, family history)</li>
                            <li>Lifestyle factors (smoking)</li>
                            <li>Test results (ECG findings, exercise test results)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Based on these inputs, the model calculates the probability of heart disease presence, which can help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients and initiate preventive measures or early treatments.</p>
